INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator

help KbCheck
  [keyIsDown, secs, keyCode, deltaSecs] = <strong>KbCheck</strong>([deviceNumber])
  
  Return keyboard status (keyIsDown), time (secs) of the status check, and
  keyboard scan code (keyCode).
  
     keyIsDown      1 if any key, including modifiers such as <shift>,
                    <control> or <caps lock> is down. 0 otherwise.
  
     secs           Time of keypress as returned by GetSecs.
  
     keyCode        A 256-element logical array.  Each bit
                    within the logical array represents one keyboard key. 
                    If a key is pressed, its bit is set, othewise the bit 
                    is clear. To convert a keyCode to a vector of key  
                    numbers use FIND(keyCode). To find a key's keyNumber 
                    use KbName or KbDemo.
  
     deltaSecs      Time in seconds since this <strong>KbCheck</strong> query and the most
                    recent previous query (if any). This value is in some
                    sense a confidence interval, e.g., for reaction time
                    measurements. If <strong>KbCheck</strong> returns the information that a
                    key is pressed by the subject, then the subject could
                    have pressed the key down anytime between this
                    invocation of <strong>KbCheck</strong> at time 'secs' and the most
                    recent previous invocation. Therefore, 'deltaSecs'
                    tells you about the interval in which depression of the
                    key(s) might have happened: [secs - deltaSecs; secs].
                    for practical purpose this means that "measured" RT's
                    can't be more accurate than 'deltaSecs' seconds - the
                    interval between the two most recent keyboard checks.
                    Please note however, that standard computer keyboards
                    can incur additional delays and timing uncertainty of
                    up to 50 msecs, so the real uncertainty can be higher
                    than 'deltaSecs' -- 'deltaSecs' is just a lower bound!
 
  <strong>KbCheck</strong> and KbWait determine whether any key is down now, including the
  meta keys: <caps lock>, <shift>, <command>, <control>, and <option>. The
  only key not reported is the start key (triangle) used to power on your
  computer.
  
  Some users of Laptops experienced the problem of "stuck keys": Some keys
  are always reported as "down", so KbWait returns immediately and <strong>KbCheck</strong>
  always reports keyIsDown == 1. This is often due to special function keys.
  These keys or system functionality are assigned vendor specific
  key codes, e.g., the status of the Laptop lid (opened/closed) could be
  reported by some special keycode. Whenever the Laptop lid is open, this key
  will be reported as pressed. You can work around this problem by passing
  a list of keycodes to be ignored by <strong>KbCheck</strong> and KbWait. See
  "help DisableKeysForKbCheck" on how to do this.
 
  Keys pressed by the subject often show up in the Matlab command window as
  well, cluttering that window with useless character junk. You can prevent
  this from happening by disabling keyboard input to Matlab: Add a
  ListenChar(2); command at the beginning of your script and a
  ListenChar(0); to the end of your script to enable/disable transmission of
  keypresses to Matlab. If your script should abort and your keyboard is
  dead, press CTRL+C to reenable keyboard input -- It is the same as
  ListenChar(0). See 'help ListenChar' for more info.
 
  GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas <strong>KbCheck</strong>
  and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key was hit,
  <strong>KbCheck</strong> will return true, because a key was pressed, but CharAvail will
  return false, because no character was generated. See GetChar.
  
  <strong>KbCheck</strong> and KbWait are MEX files, which take time to load when they're
  first called. They'll then stay loaded until you flush them (e.g. by
  changing directory or calling CLEAR MEX).
 
  <strong>KbCheck</strong> uses the PsychHID function, a general purpose function for
  reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.
 
  <strong>KbCheck</strong> queries the first USB-HID keyboard device by default. Optionally,
  when multiple keyboards are attached to your machine, you can pass in a
  'deviceNumber':  When 'deviceNumber' is -1, <strong>KbCheck</strong> will query all
  keyboard devices and return their "merged state" - The 'keyCode' vector
  will represent the state of all keys of all keyboards, and the
  'keyIsDown' flag will be equal to one if at least one key on any of the
  keyboards is pressed. When 'deviceNumber' is -2, <strong>KbCheck</strong> will query all
  keypad devices (if any) and return their "merged state", and when
  'deviceNumber' is -3, <strong>KbCheck</strong> will query all keyboard and keypad devices
  and return their "merged state". When 'deviceNumber' is greater than 0, it
  will query only the specified HID keyboard device corresponding to that
  'deviceNumber'. The function GetKeyboardIndices() allows to query the
  device numbers of all attached keyboards, or keyboards matching specific
  criteria, and the function GetKeypadIndices() allows the same for keypads.
 
  On MS-Windows 2000 and earlier, <strong>KbCheck</strong> can address individual keyboards.
  On Windows-XP and later, it can't.
 
  To save time, PsychHID and <strong>KbCheck</strong> enumerate the devices and count keyboards
  only once, and cache the answer. If you add or remove a keyboard during a
  running experiment session, you must flush their caches. Otherwise the new
  keyboard won't noticed or <strong>KbCheck</strong> may issue a fatal error trying to access
  a non-existent keyboard. However, in general it is a rather bad idea to allow
  addition or removal of devices during a running session, as various other
  Psychtoolbox functions may also cache devices and device settings and get
  confused by such surprising changes in hardware configuration.
 
    clear PsychHID; % Force new enumeration of devices.
    clear <strong>KbCheck</strong>; % Clear persistent cache of keyboard devices.
 
  As a little bonus, <strong>KbCheck</strong> can also query other HID human input devices
  which have keys or buttons as if they were keyboards. If you pass in the
  deviceIndex of a mouse (GetMouseIndices will provide with them), it will
  report mouse button state as keyboard state. Similar behaviour usually
  works with Joysticks, Gamepads and other input controllers.

PTB-INFO: some restrictions. See file 'License.txt' in the Psychtoolbox root folder for the exact licensing conditions.

PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAMSettings', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.


PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is NVIDIA Corporation :: GeForce GTX 1050 Ti/PCIe/SSE2 :: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 416.16

PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from beamposition = 16.660996 ms [60.020421 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Will use beamposition query for accurate Flip time stamping.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 16.665928 ms [60.002659 Hz]. (50 valid samples taken, stddev=0.054172 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 16.666667 ms [60.000000 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.

PTB-INFO: WINDOWS DWM DESKTOP COMPOSITOR IS ACTIVE. On this Windows-10 or later system, Psychtoolbox can no longer reliably detect if
PTB-INFO: this will cause trouble for timing and integrity of visual stimuli or not. You might be just fine, or you could be in trouble.
PTB-INFO: Use external measurement equipment and independent procedures to verify reliability of timing if you care about proper timing.

PTB-INFO: There are still 11 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 2 times out of a total of 51 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator

help DrawFormattedText
  [nx, ny, textbounds] = <strong>DrawFormattedText</strong>(win, tstring [, sx][, sy][, color][, wrapat][, flipHorizontal][, flipVertical][, vSpacing][, righttoleft][, winRect])
 
  Draws a string of text 'tstring' into Psychtoolbox window 'win'. Allows
  some basic formatting. The text string 'tstring' may contain newline
  characters '\n'. Whenever a newline character '\n' is encountered, a
  linefeed and carriage return is performed, breaking the text string into
  lines. 'sx' defines the left border of the text: If it is left out, text
  starts at x-position zero, otherwise it starts at the specified position
  'sx'. If sx=='center', then each line of text is horizontally centered in
  the window. If sx=='right', then each line of text is right justified to
  the right border of the target window, or of 'winRect' if provided. 'sy'
  defines the top border of the text. If left out, it starts at the top of
  the window, otherwise it starts at the specified vertical pixel position.
  If sy=='center', then the whole text is vertically centered in the
  window. 'color' is the color value of the text (color index or [r g b]
  triplet or [r g b a] quadruple). If color is left out, the current text
  color from previous text drawing commands is used. 'wrapat', if provided,
  will automatically break text strings longer than 'wrapat' characters
  into newline separated strings of roughly 'wrapat' characters. This is
  done by calling the WrapString function (See 'help WrapString'). 'wrapat'
  mode may not work reliably with non-ASCII text strings, e.g., UTF-8
  encoded uint8 strings on all systems.
 
  The optional flag 'flipHorizontal' if set to 1 will mirror the text
  horizontally, whereas the optional flag 'flipVertical' if set to 1 will
  mirror the text vertically (upside down).
 
  The optional argument 'vSpacing' sets the spacing between the lines. Default
  value is 1.
 
  The optional argument 'righttoleft' if set to 1, will ask to draw the
  text string in right-to-left reading direction, e.g., for scripts which
  read right to left
 
  The optional argument 'winRect' allows to specify a [left top right bottom]
  rectange, in which the text should be centered/placed etc. By default,
  the rectangle of the whole 'win'dow is used.
 
  The function employs clipping by default. Text lines that are detected as
  lying completely outside the 'win'dow or optional 'winRect' will not be
  drawn, but clipped away. This allows to draw multi-page text (multiple
  screen heights) without too much loss of drawing speed. If you find the
  clipping to interfere with text layout of exotic texts/fonts at exotic
  sizes and formatting, you can define the global variable...
 
  global ptb_drawformattedtext_disableClipping;
  ... and set it like this ...
  ptb_drawformattedtext_disableClipping = 1;
  ... to disable the clipping.
 
  Clipping also gets disabled if you request the optional 3rd return
  parameter 'textbounds' to ensure correct computation of a bounding box
  that covers the complete text. You can enforce clipping by setting
  ptb_drawformattedtext_disableClipping = -1; however, computed bounding
  boxes will then only describe the currently visible (non-clipped) text.
 
 
  The function returns the new (nx, ny) position of the text drawing cursor
  and the bounding rectangle 'textbounds' of the drawn string. (nx,ny) can
  be used as new start position for connecting further text strings to the
  bottom of the drawn text string. Calculation of these bounds is
  approximative, so it may give wrong results with some text fonts and
  styles on some operating systems.
 
  See DrawFormattedTextDemo for a usage example.

Screen('TextFont?')

Usage:

[oldFontName,oldFontNumber]=Screen('TextFont', windowPtr [,fontNameOrNumber]);

Get/Set the font for future text draws in this window.
 You can ask what the current font is, or specify the desired font by number or
by name (e.g. 'Helvetica'). Font numbers are not consistent from Mac to Mac, and
they aren't supported but silently ignored on MS-Windows and Linux, so use font
names for reliability and portability. Font numbers are only available for
backward compatibility to old OS-9 Psychtoolbox versions.
The font name can be a string of at most 255 characters length, e.g.
'Helvetica', or a list containing one string of at most 255 characters, e.g.
{'Helvetica'}. The default font depends on the operating system and is selected
for good readability. You can query and change it via a call to
Screen('Preference', 'DefaultFontName').
It's ok to request a non-existent font on OS/X; this will have no effect. If you
care, call TextFont again to find out whether you got the font you requested.
See FontDemo.
On Linux you can either provide a font name - PTB will select the closest
matching available font for that name, size and style requirements - or you can
start the fontName with a dash '-' followed by a full FontConfig font specifier
string which encodes all kinds of properties. The 'fc-list' command under Linux
allows you to query all available fonts.
Depending on the selected text renderer, Linux can be picky about the supplied
fonts - if you request a non-existent font with the old text renderer, the
DrawText command will fail with an error message. However, with the default FTGL
text renderer on Linux, Linux will be lenient in its font selection. If you call
Screen('TextFont') after you've drawn some text, the command will return the
font family name of the true selected font.

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

Screen('Flip?')

Usage:

[VBLTimestamp StimulusOnsetTime FlipTimestamp Missed Beampos] = Screen('Flip', windowPtr [, when] [, dontclear] [, dontsync] [, multiflip]);

Flip front and back display surfaces in sync with vertical retrace and return
completion timestamps.
"windowPtr" is the id of the onscreen window whose content should be shown at
flip time. "when" specifies when to flip: If set to zero (default), it will flip
on the next possible video retrace. If set to a value when > 0, it will flip at
the first video retrace after system time 'when' has been reached. "dontclear"
If set to 1, flip will not clear the framebuffer after Flip - this allows
incremental drawing of stimuli. The default is zero, which will clear the
framebuffer to background color after each flip. A value of 2 will prevent Flip
from doing anything to the framebuffer after flip. This leaves the job of
setting up the buffer to you - the framebuffer is in an undefined state after
flip. "dontsync" If set to zero (default), Flip will sync to the vertical
retrace and will pause execution of your script until the Flip has happened. If
set to 1, Flip will still synchronize stimulus onset to the vertical retrace,
but will *not* wait for the flip to happen: Flip returns immediately and all
returned timestamps are invalid. A value of 2 will cause Flip to show the
stimulus *immediately* without waiting/syncing to the vertical retrace.
"multiflip" defaults to zero: If set to a value greater than zero, Flip will
flip *all* onscreen windows instead of just the specified one. This allows to
synchronize stimulus onset on multiple displays, e.g., for multidisplay stereo
setups or haploscopes. You need to (somehow) synchronize all attached displays
for this to operate tear-free. Flip (optionally) returns a high-precision
estimate of the system time (in seconds) when the actual flip has happened in
the return argument 'VBLTimestamp'. An estimate of Stimulus-onset time is
returned in 'StimulusOnsetTime'. Beampos is the position of the monitor scanning
beam when the time measurement was taken (useful for correctness tests).
FlipTimestamp is a timestamp taken at the end of Flip's execution. Use the
difference between FlipTimestamp and VBLTimestamp to get an estimate of how long
Flips execution takes. This is useful to get a feeling for the timing error if
you try to sync script execution to the retrace, e.g., for triggering
acquisition devices like EEG, fMRI, or for starting playback of a sound.
"Missed" indicates if the requested presentation deadline for your stimulus has
been missed. A negative value means that dead- lines have been satisfied.
Positive values indicate a deadline-miss. The automatic detection of
deadline-miss is not fool-proof - it can report false positives and also false
negatives, although it should work fairly well with most experimental setups. If
you are picky about timing, please use the provided timestamps or additional
methods to exercise your own tests.

PTB-INFO: There are still 12 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 52 times out of a total of 6617 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

PTB-INFO: There are still 11 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 9 times out of a total of 960 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

Error in function Flip: 	Invalid Window (or Texture) Index provided: It doesn't correspond to an open window or texture.

PTB-INFO: There are still 12 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 464 times out of a total of 313956 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

PTB-INFO: Multi-display setup in explicit multi-display mode detected. Using the following mapping:
PTB-INFO: Screen 0 corresponds to the full Windows desktop area. Useful for stereo presentations in stereomode=4 ...
PTB-INFO: Screen 1 corresponds to the display area of the monitor with the Windows-internal name \\.\DISPLAY1 ...
PTB-INFO: Screen 2 corresponds to the display area of the monitor with the Windows-internal name \\.\DISPLAY2 ...
PTB-WARNING: Screens 1 and 2 do have non-equal width and height. This will probably cause wrong behaviour
PTB-WARNING: when trying to open a fullscreen window on Screen 0 that is supposed to fully cover displays 1 and 2.
PTB-WARNING: In that case, either change your screen settings to matching size and refresh rate in the display control
PTB-WARNING: panel and retry after a 'clear all', or manually specify a [rect] parameter for the window in the
PTB-WARNING: Screen('OpenWindow', 0, [color], [rect]); command to manually enforce creation of a proper onscreen window.

PTB-INFO: There are still 12 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 482 times out of a total of 311634 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

PTB-INFO: There are still 12 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 495 times out of a total of 313036 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

PTB-INFO: There are still 12 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 463 times out of a total of 313996 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.

Tried to prepare a new configuration phase via PsychImaging('PrepareConfiguration'), but did not finalize the previous phase yet.
You must call the PsychImaging('OpenWindow', ...); command at least once to open an onscreen
window according to the provided settings, before you can specify settings for additional onscreen windows.

The most likely reason you see this error message is because your script aborted with some error
before it managed to open the onscreen window. In that case it is best practice to execute a 'clear all'
command at the Matlab/Octave prompt before you restart your script.

I will restart configuration now and forget the previously made PsychImaging('AddTask', ...); settings.

help readtable
 <strong>readtable</strong> Create a table by reading from a file.
    Use the <strong>readtable</strong> function to create a table by reading column-oriented data from
    a file. <strong>readtable</strong> can automatically determine the file format from its extension
    as described below.
 
    T = <strong>readtable</strong>(FILENAME) creates a table by reading from the file FILENAME, and
    determines the file format from its extension. The extension must be one of those
    listed below.
 
    T = <strong>readtable</strong>(FILENAME,'FileType',FILETYPE) specifies the file type, where
    FILETYPE is one of 'text' or 'spreadsheet'.
 
    T = <strong>readtable</strong>(FILENAME,OPTS) creates a table from the file FILENAME using the
    supplied ImportOptions OPTS. OPTS specifies variable names, selected variable
    names, variable types, and other information regarding the location of the data.
 
    For example, import a sub-set of the data in a file:
        opts = detectImportOptions('patients.xls') opts.SelectedVariableNames =
        {'Systolic','Diastolic'} T = readtable('patients.xls',opts)
 
    <strong>readtable</strong> reads data from different file types as follows:
 
    .txt, .dat, .csv:  Delimited text file.
 
           Reading from a delimited text file creates one variable in T for each
           column in the file. Variable names are taken from the first row of the
           file. By default, the variables created are either double, if the entire
           column is numeric, datetime, duration, or text. If data in a column cannot be 
           converted to numeric, datetime or duration, the column is imported as text.
           <strong>readtable</strong> converts empty fields in the file to either NaN
           (for a numeric or duration variable), NaT (for a datetime variable), or the empty 
           character vector or string (for a text variables). Insignificant whitespace 
           in the file is ignored.
 
           Use the following optional parameter name/value pairs to control how data
           are read from a delimited text file:
 
           'Delimiter'     The delimiter used in the file. Can be any of ' ',
                           '\t', ',', ';', '|' or their corresponding names 'space',
                           'tab', 'comma', 'semi', or 'bar'. If unspecified,
                           <strong>readtable</strong> detects the delimiter automatically.
 
           'ReadVariableNames'  A logical value that specifies whether or not
                           the first row (after skipping HeaderLines) of the file is
                           treated as variable names. If unspecified, <strong>readtable</strong>
                           detects the presence of variable names automatically.
 
           'ReadRowNames'  A logical value that specifies whether or not the
                           first column of the file is treated as row names. Default
                           is false. If the 'ReadVariableNames' and 'ReadRowNames'
                           parameter values are both true, the name in the first
                           column of the first row is saved as the first dimension
                           name for the table.
 
           'TreatAsEmpty'  One or more text values to be treated as the empty
                           in a numeric column. This may be a character vector, a
                           cell array of character vectors, or string array. Table 
                           elements corresponding to these are set to NaN. 'TreatAsEmpty' 
                           only applies to numeric columns in the file, and numeric
                           literals such as '-99' are not accepted.
 
           'HeaderLines'   The number of lines to skip at the beginning of the
                           file. If unspecified, <strong>readtable</strong> detects the number of
                           lines to skip automatically.
 
           'Format'        A format specifier to define the columns in the file,
                           as accepted by the TEXTSCAN function. Type
                           "help textscan" for information about format strings and
                           additional parameters. Specifying the format can
                           significantly improve speed for some large files. If
                           unspecified, <strong>readtable</strong> detects the format automatically.
 
           'DateLocale'    The locale that <strong>readtable</strong> uses to interpret month and
                           day names in datetime text read with the %D format
                           specifier. LOCALE must be a character vector or scalar
                           string in the form xx_YY. See the documentation for
                           DATETIME for more information.
 
           'Encoding'      The character encoding scheme associated with the
                           file. It must be 'system' or a name or alias for an
                           encoding scheme. <strong>readtable</strong> supports the same character
                           encodings as FOPEN. Some examples are 'UTF-8', 'latin1',
                           'US-ASCII', and 'Shift_JIS'. If the 'Encoding' parameter
                           value is 'system', then <strong>readtable</strong> uses your system's
                           default encoding.
 
                           See the documentation for FOPEN for more information.
 
           'TextType'      The output type of text variables. Text variables are
                           those with %s, %q, or %[...] formats. It can have either
                           of the following values:
                              'char'   - Return text as a cell array of
                                         character vectors.
                              'string' - Return text as a string array.
 
           'DatetimeType'  The output type of date variables. The possible values
                           are:                         
                               'datetime' - Return dates as MATLAB datetimes.
                               'text'     - Return dates as text.
 
           'DurationType'  The output type of time variables. The possible
                           values are:
                               'duration' - Return time data as MATLAB durations.
                               'text'     - Return time data as text.
 
    .xls, .xlsx, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xltm, .xltx, .ods:  Spreadsheet file.
 
           Reading from a spreadsheet file creates one variable in T for each column
           in the file. By default, the variables created are either double, datetime or text.
           Variable names are taken from the first row of the spreadsheet.
 
           Use the following optional parameter name/value pairs to control how data
           are read from a spreadsheet file:
 
           'ReadVariableNames'  A logical value that specifies whether or not
                           the first row of the specified region of the file is
                           treated as variable names. Default is true.
 
           'ReadRowNames'  A logical value that specifies whether or not the
                           first column of specified region of the file is treated as
                           row names. Default is false. If the 'ReadVariableNames'
                           and 'ReadRowNames' parameter values are both true, the
                           name in the first column of the first row is saved as the
                           first dimension name for the table.
 
           'TreatAsEmpty'  One or more text values to be treated as an empty cell
                           in a numeric column. This may be a character vector, a
                           cell array of character vectors, or string array. Table
                           elements corresponding to these are set to NaN.
                           'TreatAsEmpty' only applies to numeric columns in the
                           file, and numeric literals such as '-99' are not accepted.
 
           'Sheet'         The sheet to read, specified as the worksheet name,
                           or a positive integer indicating the worksheet index.
 
           'Range'         A character vector or scalar string that specifies a
                           rectangular portion of the worksheet to read, using the
                           Excel A1 reference style. If the spreadsheet contains
                           figures or other non-tabular information, you should use
                           the 'Range' parameter to read only the tabular data. By
                           default, <strong>readtable</strong> reads data from a spreadsheet
                           contiguously out to the right-most column that contains
                           data, including any empty columns that precede it. If the
                           spreadsheet contains one or more empty columns between
                           columns of data, use the 'Range' parameter to specify a
                           rectangular range of cells from which to read variable
                           names and data. An empty character vector ('') signifies
                           all data in the sheet.
 
           'Basic'         A logical value specifying whether or not to read the
                           spreadsheet in basic mode. Basic mode is the default for
                           systems without Excel for Windows installed. Basic mode
                           may read files where there may be live updates (e.g.
                           formula evalauation or plugins) to the data differently.
                           If your files do not have this requirement, basic mode can
                           be used.
 
           'TextType'      The output type of text variables. It can have either of
                           the following values:
                              'char'   - Return text as a cell array of
                              character vectors. 
                              'string' - Return text as a string array.
 
           'DatetimeType'  The output type of datetime variables. The possible values
                           are:
                               'datetime'     - Return dates as MATLAB datetimes. 
                               'text'         - Return dates as text.
                               'exceldatenum' - Return dates as Excel serial day date numbers.
 
    Parameters which are also accepted with import options. These may have slightly
    different behavior when used with import options:
 
        T = readtable(FILENAME, OPTS, ...parameters...)
 
          'ReadVariableNames' true - Reads the variable names from
                                     opts.VariableNamesRange/VariableNamesLine location.
                             false - Uses variable names from the import options.
                                        
          'ReadRowNames'      true - Reads the row names from the
                                     opts.RowNamesRange/RowNameColumn location.
                             false - Does not import row names.
 
        Text only parameters:
          'DateLocale'     Override the locale used when importing dates.
          'Encoding'       Override the encoding defined in import options.
 
        Spreadsheet only parameters:
          'Sheet'          Override the sheet value in the import options.
          'Basic'          No difference.
